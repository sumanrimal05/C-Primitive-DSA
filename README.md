# Data Structures and Basic Programming Concepts in C

This repository contains my attempt to implement fundamental data structures and programming concepts typically available in higher-level programming languages, using C. By building these from scratch, I aim to deepen my understanding of programming fundamentals and memory management in C.

### Goals

1. **Implement Core Data Structures**: Create structures like a dynamic array (similar to vectors) with operations to add, remove, and resize elements.
2. **Implement Algorithms**: Add sorting and searching algorithms to understand their low-level implementations.
3. **Simulate Object-Oriented Concepts**: Implement basic features of classes and inheritance, allowing better code organization and reuse in C.
4. **Practice Memory Management**: Focus on pointers, function pointers, and manual memory management to ensure efficient and secure handling of resources.
